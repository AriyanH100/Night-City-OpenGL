# Night City using OpenGL
CSE423 Project

This is my first project on Computer Graphics based on "Night City" using OpenGL. This project shows a night city with animations where the lights of windows go on and off, stars moving, cars passing by. Algorithms such as "Midpoint Circle Algorithm" were used to develop this project.
